# This a digital adaptation of the boardgame [Super Farmer](https://www.rebel.pl/gry-planszowe/super-farmer-z-rancha-26059.html) made using the Unity engine.

## Most of the art in the game is a placeholder (I'm a terrible artist and ui designer) - you can get the executables for Windows and MacOS(Apple Silicon) in the Releases tab.
